Analysis of Heathcare Associated Infections across US hospitals by type, size, and ownership.
</h1>	
<p>
	Using data from data.gov, we analyzed Healthcare Associated Infections across the nation in order to determine which type of hospital and which source of funding had the most infections
</p>

<p>
	The resulting data shows that most infections occur in General Accute Care hospitals, however, this type of hospital is the most numerous among all types. Privately owned hospitals have the least number of infections across all funding types.
